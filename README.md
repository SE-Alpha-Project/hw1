## What Are Fibonacci Numbers?
Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence typically starts as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

Mathematically, the sequence is defined as:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

## Why Are Fibonacci Numbers Important?
Fibonacci numbers are important because they appear in many natural phenomena, including the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the flowering of an artichoke, and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts. These numbers also appear in mathematical contexts such as combinatorics, number theory, and the analysis of algorithms. The Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio, an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618, which is also significant in art, architecture, and nature.

## Real-World Use Cases of Fibonacci Numbers
1. **Biology and Nature:**
   - **Phyllotaxis:** The arrangement of leaves, seeds, and petals in plants often follows the Fibonacci sequence, which optimizes the exposure to sunlight and rainfall.
   - **Animal Patterns:** The Fibonacci sequence can describe the branching of trees, the arrangement of pine cone scales, and the pattern of shells.

2. **Stock Market:**
   - **Fibonacci Retracement Levels:** Traders use Fibonacci retracement levels as a tool to predict potential reversal points in financial markets. These levels are calculated by dividing the difference between a high and a low by Fibonacci ratios (23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, etc.).

3. **Art and Architecture:**
   - **The Golden Ratio:** The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approximates the golden ratio, which has been used in art and architecture to achieve aesthetically pleasing proportions. The Parthenon, the Pyramids of Giza, and works by Leonardo da Vinci all feature proportions close to the golden ratio.

4. **Cryptography:**
   - **Pseudo-Random Number Generation:** Fibonacci numbers are sometimes used in the generation of pseudo-random numbers, which are crucial in cryptography for secure encryption algorithms.

Fibonacci numbers are pervasive in both the natural world and human-created systems, serving as a bridge between mathematics, nature, art, and technology.
